### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



My name is Claire Mevolhon and I am a developper in Artificial Intelligence.  
I have a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence and Pattern Recognition, that include computer vision, robotics and AI.  

I really like AI: different algorithms with "simple" concepts and an amazing output!  

I also really like computer vision. I was lucky to work on a facial recognition, and I worked with DLib, OpenCV and some CNN.


However, I also worked on several projects without AI, for example I implemented some codes for SEVRI.  
You can also see some Jupyter notebooks that I regrouped [here](https://canneltigrou.github.io)  

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/claire-mevolhon/?locale=en_US)
